
What is the resource limitation by derfault for running containers?

where container vertualizatoin happens?
 in OS level

Using linux Cgroups, namespace to create separate env , how to see it ?
does each cgroup limit a specific resource?e.g. cgroup 1 for cpu, cgroup2 for memory?
		yes
what is docker ?
		its a runtime engine for containers
Different container engine?
		Podman
		rocket

What about mesos?

network status of your system?
	install  net-tools 
	command is netstat -nlpt
	
why k8 if docker is there?

can we define quota or resource limits for containers?
	
Can we interact with container on master, using docker client on worker1?


API server ? ---> user put and get resource from k8 

Scheduler ? ----> responsible to create container in best suit worker node.

Controller manager ? ----> Manage all resource of container and worker node up and running.

cloud Controller manager ? ----> 

etcd ---> 

kublet ---> it is and agent at worker nodes which check the container runtime ( docker ) is running or not in cluster.
			the hart bit send to controller.

kubectl ----> it is the command lines which communicate to k8 master's API server.

kube proxy ---> 

pods ---> 	

kubeadm ---> it is the command using it you can create master and worker node 

pki folder ----> get the certificates 

sudo hostnamectl set-hostname master.example.com

How to manage the cluster?
	kubeadm
	
How to create k8 dashboard?

What is the difference between cluster_ip and nodeport?

What is etcd?
		it is non relational database keeps key value pair to store pod details.
so pod name should be uniq.

how to take backup of etcd?
	using etcd-client
Why to take backup of etcd?
	if master goes down then you can restore it.
	
why upgrade cluster?
	To get more features

How to take etcd backup?

How to get apiVersion in k8?

How to check the available upgrade version
	kubeadm upgrade plan

How to list of supported resources in k8?
	kubectl api-resources 

what and why is pod?
	k8 only manage pod but not container directly.
	it will help to provide proper security , monitoring , logging to the application.
	Also these can share the storage and data easily.
	if any one of the resource container stops working, kubernetes will consider pod is not in running state.

How to know what are the fileds needed in pod?
	kubectl explain pod    ( you will get the apiversion  for pod)

explain the spec ?
	kubectl explain pod.spec.containers

why to use kubectl apply ?

what is the version use in deployment?
	kubctl explain deploy.Apiversion
	
why init container in pod?
	Let think there is some media file in S3 bucket.
	once we download the media using a container and then the main container will start.
	once main container start then it complete the media download container.
	
	
	Real time example --->  DB ( check pod running or not )--- app ( check pod running or not ) --- web 
How to block the container to user specific memory and cpu.
	resources is the block where we specify it 
		
		resources:
			requests:
				
How to crate a pod bypassing the Apiserver and run it in kubelet ?

	create the pod yaml file in manifast folder.
	
	cd /etc/kubernetes/manifast
		vi mypordyaml
		
how to access a pord?
	kubectl exec 

why deployment in k8?
	deployment is a control method.
	
	It use to create identical multiple pods.
	if you update the yaml and use deployment to update the pods / container in pods.
	old pod will not deleted if the new change in yaml create a successful pod
	
	so for this we need replicas and template
	
	kubctl explain deploy

How to get all deployment?
	kubctl get deploy

how to get the history of deployment?

	kubctl rollout history deploy/nginx-deploy

How to delete a revision?
		
	
how to scaling the pod?
	in scaling the history of deployment is not change.
	
How to see the ReplicaSet ( rs ) created by the Deployment?
	kubectl get rs

update the image from command line in k8 ( canery deployment )?
	kubctl set image
	kubctl set image deployment/nginx-dep nginx=nginx:1.16.1

Two type of deployment  in k8?

	kubectl explain deploy.spec.strategy.type
		recreate ( blue green )and rolloutbuind ( canery )

How to start a stoped container in a pod?
	not posible in k8 
	
why DaemonSet?
	A DaemonSet ensures that all eligible nodes run a copy of a Pod.

Who create DaemonSet?
	control manager

How to see the DaemonSet?

	kubectl get ds -A

ELK, EFK, FluentD

why job?
	one time execution and then competed state
	ex -- db backup , add table 
How to check the job
	kubectl get jobs
	
how to check the cron job in k8?
	kubectl get cronjobs
	
env --> it use to keep the property for the container  in k8

what is configmap?

	it will store in etcd

how to acces the configmap property in application?
	
what is difference between env and configmap

kubectl explain pod.spec.containers.env.valueFrom --recursive

cm-reloader --> the plugin use to change in configmap will update the pod 

why secret?

why label?

how to add label to node / pod ?

how to remve the label?
	kubectl label node worker-2 labelKey-  # at the end there will be a hypen 
	
differnece between label and matchlabel?

what is selecter?

What is namespace?

How to add the pod in namespace?
	kubctl apply -f abc.yml -n namespace_name


role base access in namespace?

How to set resource quota in namespace?

How to decometion an application in k8?
	kubectl delete namespace_name
	
why scheduling?


why master node not allowing scheduler to create pod in master?
	Taints is a label which does it
	To overcome from this we can use "tolerations" in yaml file with effect: NoSchedule

	Taints is a node property and tolerations is a pod property.
	
How to remove Taints ?

	kubectl taint nodes node_name app=example:NoSchedule-

when you want to dediate specific group of nodes for the pods?
	taints and tolerations
	
How to get all the resource of namespace?
	kubctl get all -n namespace_name

see list of revison of my deployment?

Node affinity ---> what is the difference between NoSchedule and NoExecute?

what is podAffinity and pod antiAffinity?

underlay network?
	ping command use underlay network.

overlay network / CNI container network interface?
	cNI use overlay network.
	
	kubctl apply -f cni_link

where is k8 dns / kube-dns ?	
	k get svc -n kube-system

Note --> service , deployment and ns are logical layers.

why service? ( service discovery)

	when there is change in prod then new pod is created
with new ip address. 
	By using the selector the service come to know its pods ( pod label)
service is not changing. 
	For that reasion we use service.

service port and pod port connected through target port.

service type?
	cluserip , nodeport , loadbalncer , ingress 


where you get the service_cluster_ip range? where is service ip network range ?

	/etc/kubernetes/manifast/kube-apiserver

how service know to diract traffic to the pod?
	
	using endpoints (which is created by service.)
	
	kubctl get ep pod_name -n namespace_name
	
How Load balance happens in service?
	using endpoints

How to create a service?
	kubectl expose
	
	kubectl expose deployment orders_app --name orders --port 80 --target-port 8080
	
	
what is internal LB?
	cluster_ip is the internal LB 
	
	ex-->database no need to expose outside world.
	
what is nodePort?
	NodePort is a port mapping where a port will be open.
	it is cluster based communication.
	
	ex--> access app using comany interact  ( jira , jenkins , git etc )
	
What is Load balancer?
	when app is expose to the outside world is use load balancer.
	
how to change clusterip to nodePort?
	
	kubectl expose deployment mysql --port=3306 --type nodePort	

	
full qulified ip address?
	nslookup
	
find difference type of volumes in pod lebel?
	kubectl explain pod.spec.volumes  	

Share the volume between containers which present in same pod ?
	emptyDir use to share the volume between container
	once pod deleted the data will wipe out.
	
create volumes in pod lebel?
	use the block "volumes" in your pod yaml file.
		volumes:
			- name: exchanges
			  emptyDir: {}
			  
How container use the pod volume?
	use "volumeMounts" in your container section in your pod yaml
	
		volumeMounts:
			- name: exchanges 
			  mountPath: "/tmp/yourpath"

How to access perticular container in k8?

	kubectl exec pod_name -c container_name -- linux_command


how to share the data between the pods within the same node?
	hostPath volume only consume if the pods are in same node

	we need to use "hostPath" in your pod yaml
		volumes:
			- name: log-volume
			  hostPath:
				path: /var/log
				type: directory
				
How to use the hostPath volume in container?
		
Why hostPath is non-persistent volume?

	in k8 worker nodes are dynamic and pod can be created on any of them.
	so the volume created by hostPath may not use by the pod once it is recreated as it may go to differnent worker node.
	
why we use configmap in storage volume in pod?
how to load a property file in container in pod?
	To read property file from node/from some location  to the container present in pod.
	
why we use secret in storage volume in pod?
how to load a secret file in container in pod?
	To read secret file from node/from some location  to the container present in pod.
	
why persistent volume?
	ex to store the database data which we can not make it public.
	in that case we chose persistent volume.
	
how to create persistent volume?
	using  persistentVolume and persistentVolumeClaim
	
	kubectl explain pv.spec   --> different type of storage volume  

	kind: persistentVolume
			and
	storageClassName: manual   ( for non cloud / san  / nfs)
			and 
	hostPath: 
		path: "/mnt/data"

suppose i have 7g , 5g , 3g pv i need 4g  pvc then it can got to any one from 5g or 7g which storage size it will chose?
	5g

how to check the pvc?
	kubectl get pvc
	
what is accessModes ReadWriteMany ?
	if pv has accessModes ReadWriteMany then multiple container in pod can access the storage (pv) mapped to pvc.
			  
What is self healing pods / if there is issue how pod get fixs itself?
	always pod should created under deployment in real time.
	
	pod ---> containers ---> images ( pod running then all containers running)
	
	it is done by probeing. two type of probes --> readiness probs and liveness probs.
	actually the app in the container is running or not determine by readiness and liveness
	in readiness service will not allow the tarffic if container has any issue.
	in liveness the pod will be restarted if there any issue in container.
	
	healthz ( Health Check in LB / health check api in realtime)		  
	
How to prioritize the pod?
	priorityClassName 
	
	kubectl api-resources | grep priority 
	
	kubectl get pc
	

How k8 give us authentication?
	.kube/config we get authentication.
	
how to check different roles in k8?
	kubectl get roles

		application role --> when role given to the apps in namespace
		cluster role --> The user able to create/list/update/delete difference resource ( deployment , nodes , namespace )in cluster.
		
Different policys in k8?
	using the below policy we can create difference roles for the users

	c	--- create
	r	--- list ( get ) and describe
	U	--- edit , update and apply
	D	--- delete

Roles are the part of namespace or not?

	kubectl api-resources | rep  -i role

how to create the role in k8?
	using command or yaml file
	
	create a developer role
	------------------------
	kubectl create role developer --verb=create --verb=get --verb=list --resource=pods -n my_namespace
	
How to create a rolebuinding in k8?

	bind the user sumanta to developer role
	----------------------------------------
	kubectl create rolebinding developer-binding-sumanta --role=developer --user=sumanta -n my_namespace
	
	kubectl get rolebinding -n my_namespace
	
how to check the sumanta is able to do the task or not?

	kubectl get pods -n my_namespace --as sumanta
	
How to promote as user from application role to cluster role
	
	kubectl create cluserrole nodes-admin-role --verb=get,list --resource=nodes
	
how to bind a user to the cluserrole?
	kubectl create clusterrolebinding nodes-admin-binding-sumanta --clusterrole=nodes-admin-role --user=sumanta
	
what is resource quota?
	kubectl api-resources | grep -i quota    ( it is part of namespace)
	
	Resourse quota use for pod in namespace. So it is mentioned at the time of namespace creation.
